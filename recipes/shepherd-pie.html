    </p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <li>
        <ul>One Tablespoon of Sunflower Oil</ul>
        <ul>One Large Onion (chopped)</ul>
        <ul>Two Medium Carrots (chopped)</ul>
        <ul>500g Lamb Mince</ul>
        <ul>Two Tablespoons of Tomato Puree</ul>
        <ul>Worcestershire Sauce</ul>
        <ul>500ml Beef Stock</ul>
        <ul>900g Potatoes</ul>
        <ul>85g Butter</ul>
        <ul>Three Tablespoons of Milk</ul>
    </li>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
    <li>
        <ol>Heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil in a medium saucepan, then soften 1 chopped onion and 2-3 chopped carrots for a few mins.</ol>
        <ol>When soft, turn up the heat, crumble in 500g lamb mince and brown, tipping off any excess fat.</ol>
        <ol>Add 2 tbsp tomato pur√©e and a large splash of Worcestershire sauce, then fry for a few mins.</ol>
        <ol>Pour over 500ml beef stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and cook for 40 mins, uncovering halfway.</ol>
        <ol>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 180C/fan 160C/gas 4, then make the mash. Boil the 900g potato, cut into chunks, in salted water for 10-15 mins until tender. Drain, then mash with 85g butter and 3 tbsp milk.</ol>
        <ol>Put the mince into an ovenproof dish, top with the mash and ruffle with a fork. The pie can now be chilled and frozen for up to a month.</ol>
        <ol>Bake for 20-25 mins until the top is starting to colour and the mince is bubbling through at the edges. (To bake from frozen, cook at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1 hr-1 hr 20 mins until piping hot in the centre. Flash under the grill to brown, if you like.)</ol>
        <ol>Leave to stand for 5 mins before serving.</ol>
